# Code 
1. clean_ver.m is used to train and test multi-task learning model.
2. mtl_data.m is used to prepare data for training and testing multi-task learning model
3. cal_dist2.m is used to calculate the distance matrix
4. The features are extracted by [vl_feat](http://www.vlfeat.org/index.html).

You need to have [multi-task learning model](http://ebonilla.github.io/mtgp/) in your matlab path to run this code.
